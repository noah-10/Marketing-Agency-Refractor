## Description

- This is a refractor of the original code given of a marketing agency website.
- It fixed all non-semantic elements to be semantic.
- Made the html elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
- Added alt attributes to all images, so the website could be accesible by all.
- Header attributes are now in sequential order.
- Gave the webpage a title.
